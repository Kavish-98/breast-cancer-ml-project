# breast-cancer-ml-project
Machine Learning project for predicting breast cancer patient mortality and survival using classification models.

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks developed for a Machine Learning & Data Mining project. The project focuses on predicting mortality status and survival months of breast cancer patients using a real-world clinical dataset. It includes data understanding, preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and MLP.

# üß† Breast Cancer Mortality Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project is  **Machine Learning & Data Mining**. It aims to predict breast cancer patient **mortality status** and **survival months** using clinical features from a real-world dataset.

The workflow is organized into three Jupyter Notebooks covering data understanding, preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
